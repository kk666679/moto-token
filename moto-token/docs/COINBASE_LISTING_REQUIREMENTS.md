Coinbase has a rigorous review process for listing new assets on its platform. While the specific details are not fully public, the following are the key areas of focus:

**1. Legal and Compliance:**
- **Regulatory Compliance:** The asset must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where Coinbase operates. This includes securities laws, anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, and sanctions compliance.
- **Legal Opinion:** Issuers may be required to provide a legal opinion from a qualified law firm analyzing the asset's legal and regulatory status.
- **Decentralization:** Coinbase prefers to list assets that are sufficiently decentralized, which can help to mitigate regulatory risks.

**2. Technical Security:**
- **Code Audits:** The asset's smart contracts must have undergone a thorough security audit by a reputable firm to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- **Security Best Practices:** The project must follow security best practices in its development, deployment, and ongoing operations.
- **Network Security:** The underlying blockchain network must be secure and have a proven track record of stability and resilience.

**3. Project and Team:**
- **Experienced Team:** The project should have a strong and experienced team with a clear vision and a track record of execution.
- **Whitepaper and Documentation:** The project must have a comprehensive whitepaper and clear documentation that explains its technology, tokenomics, and use case.
- **Transparency:** The project should be transparent about its development, governance, and token distribution.

**4. Tokenomics:**
- **Fair Distribution:** The token distribution should be fair and transparent, with no single entity holding an excessive amount of the total supply.
- **Utility:** The token should have a clear and compelling use case within its ecosystem.
- **Liquidity:** The token should have sufficient liquidity on reputable decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to support a healthy trading market.

**5. Market and Community:**
- **Community Engagement:** The project should have a strong and active community of users, developers, and supporters.
- **Market Demand:** There should be clear evidence of market demand for the asset.

**Application Process:**
- Asset issuers can apply to have their tokens listed on Coinbase through the **Coinbase Asset Hub**. The application requires detailed information about the project, team, technology, and legal and compliance status.
- Coinbase does not charge any fees for listing an asset.

**Note:** Meeting these requirements does not guarantee that an asset will be listed on Coinbase. The final decision is made by Coinbase's Digital Asset Listing Group (DALG) based on a comprehensive review of all factors.
