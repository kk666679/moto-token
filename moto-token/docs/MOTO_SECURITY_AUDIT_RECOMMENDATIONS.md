## Critical Security Considerations

### High-Risk Areas

#### 1. DEX Integration
```solidity
// Critical: Uniswap V2 router interactions
function _swapTokensForETH(uint256 tokenAmount) private returns (uint256 ethReceived) {
    // Potential vulnerabilities:
    // - Slippage manipulation
    // - Sandwich attacks
    // - Price manipulation
    // - Router contract changes
}
```

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Implement slippage protection
- Use deadline parameters
- Monitor for router updates
- Add emergency pause functionality

#### 2. Fee Distribution
```solidity
// Critical: Fee calculation and distribution
function _distributeFees(uint256 feeAmount) private {
    // Potential vulnerabilities:
    // - Division by zero
    // - Integer overflow/underflow
    // - Rounding errors
    // - Reentrancy attacks
}
```

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Use SafeMath library
- Implement reentrancy guards
- Add input validation
- Test edge cases thoroughly

#### 3. Access Control
```solidity
// Critical: Owner-only functions
function updateFeeRates(uint256 _buybackRate, uint256 _liquidityRate) external onlyOwner {
    // Potential vulnerabilities:
    // - Owner key compromise
    // - Function selector collisions
    // - Access control bypass
}
```

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Implement multi-signature wallets
- Use timelocks for critical changes
- Add function pause capabilities
- Regular key rotation
