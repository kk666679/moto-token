## Overview

Moto Token implements a sophisticated hyper-deflationary tokenomics model designed for long-term sustainability and holder value appreciation. The three-pillar economy creates a self-reinforcing cycle of growth, deflation, and stability.

**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 $MOTO
**Circulating Supply:** 600,000,000 $MOTO
**Network:** Base (Coinbase Layer 2)
**Contract Type:** ERC-20 with Custom Fee Logic

---

## Core Tokenomics Principles

### 1. Hyper-Deflationary Design
- **Supply Reduction:** Continuous token burning through buybacks
- **Automatic Mechanisms:** Self-executing economic policies
- **Holder Protection:** Built-in price support mechanisms

### 2. Three-Pillar Economy
- **Rewards:** ETH reflections for passive income
- **Deflation:** Buyback and burn for scarcity
- **Stability:** Auto-liquidity for trading efficiency

### 3. Sustainable Growth
- **Self-Funding:** Transaction fees fund all operations
- **Community Benefits:** Value accrues to token holders
- **Long-term Vision:** Multi-year economic model

## Fee Structure

### Transaction Fee Overview

**Total Fee Rate:** 5% on all transfers

| Component | Percentage | Purpose | Mechanism |
|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| **Buyback & Burn** | **2%** | Supply Deflation | Funds automated buybacks |
| **ETH Reflections** | **1.8%** | Holder Rewards | Distributes ETH to holders |
| **Liquidity Provision** | **1.2%** | Pool Stability | Adds to trading liquidity |
| **Total** | **5%** | **Ecosystem Sustainability** | **Self-reinforcing economy** |

### Fee Distribution Flow

```
User Transfer → 5% Fee Collected
├── 2% → Buyback Contract → Swap MOTO → Burn
├── 1.8% → Vault Contract → Convert to ETH → Distribute to Holders
└── 1.2% → Vault Contract → Add to Liquidity Pool
```

---

## Detailed Fee Mechanisms

### Pillar 1: Buyback & Burn (2%)

#### Mechanism
- **Collection:** 2% of each transaction collected in Buyback contract
- **Execution:** Contract swaps MOTO for ETH on BaseSwap
- **Final Step:** Uses ETH to buy more MOTO and burns tokens

#### Benefits
- **Supply Reduction:** Permanent removal of tokens from circulation
- **Price Support:** Creates artificial buy pressure
- **Deflationary Pressure:** Reduces total supply over time
- **Self-Funding:** No external capital required

#### Mathematical Impact
```
Burn Rate = Transaction Volume × 0.02
Annual Burn % = (Burn Rate × 365) / Circulating Supply
```

### Pillar 2: ETH Reflections (1.8%)

#### Mechanism
- **Collection:** 1.8% of fees collected in AccumulatingVault
- **Conversion:** MOTO fees converted to ETH via BaseSwap
- **Distribution:** ETH distributed proportionally to holders

#### Benefits
- **Passive Income:** Holders earn ETH without selling
- **Stability:** ETH rewards hedge against MOTO volatility
- **Accessibility:** Easy to claim and use rewards
- **Incentive:** Encourages long-term holding

#### Distribution Formula
```
Holder Reward = (Holder Balance / Total Supply) × ETH Available
```

### Pillar 3: Auto-Liquidity (1.2%)

#### Mechanism
- **Collection:** 1.2% of fees collected in AccumulatingVault
- **Conversion:** MOTO fees converted to ETH
- **Addition:** Balanced liquidity added to MOTO/ETH pool

#### Benefits
- **Price Stability:** Reduces slippage on trades
- **Trading Efficiency:** Improves user experience
- **Pool Health:** Maintains deep liquidity
- **Self-Growth:** Liquidity increases automatically

#### Liquidity Addition
```
Token Amount = Fee Amount × 0.6
ETH Amount = Converted ETH × 0.5
```

## Supply Mechanics

### Initial Distribution

| Allocation | Amount | Percentage | Purpose |
|------------|--------|------------|---------|
| **Public Sale** | **300M** | **30%** | Community distribution |
| **Liquidity Pool** | **200M** | **20%** | Initial trading liquidity |
| **Treasury** | **100M** | **10%** | Development & operations |
| **Team** | **50M** | **5%** | Core development (vested) |
| **Initial Burn** | **400M** | **40%** | Immediate deflation |
| **Total** | **1B** | **100%** | Complete allocation |

### Circulating Supply Dynamics

**Initial Circulating:** 600,000,000 MOTO

#### Supply Reduction Factors
1. **Buyback Burns:** Continuous token removal
2. **Transaction Burns:** Permanent reduction through fees
3. **Deflationary Pressure:** Net reduction over time

#### Supply Growth Factors
1. **Liquidity Additions:** New tokens added to pools
2. **Reward Distributions:** New tokens for incentives
3. **Ecosystem Expansion:** Future utility additions

## Economic Model Analysis

### Deflationary Mechanics

#### Burn Rate Calculation
```
Daily Burn Rate = Average Daily Volume × 0.02
Monthly Burn Rate = Daily Burn Rate × 30
Annual Burn % = (Monthly Burn Rate × 12) / Circulating Supply
```

#### Supply Reduction Projection
- **Month 1-3:** 2-5% reduction through burns
- **Month 3-6:** 5-10% reduction through burns
- **Month 6-12:** 10-20% reduction through burns
- **Year 2:** 30-50% reduction through burns

### Reward System

#### ETH Reflection Distribution
- **Frequency:** Continuous (processed in batches)
- **Claiming:** Manual or automatic
- **Minimum Claim:** 0.001 ETH
- **Cooldown:** 1 hour between claims

#### Reward Calculation
```
Daily ETH Rewards = (Daily Volume × 0.018) × ETH Price
Annual Holder Reward = Daily ETH Rewards × 365 × Holder %
```

### Liquidity Management

#### Auto-Liquidity Efficiency
- **Pool Depth:** Maintains 10-20% of market cap in liquidity
- **Rebalancing:** Automatic ratio maintenance
- **Slippage Protection:** Built-in tolerance settings
- **Emergency Removal:** Owner-controlled liquidity removal

### Exempt Addresses
- **Owner:** Deployment wallet (transfers fee-free)

## Mathematical Models

### Supply Reduction Model
```
S(t) = S₀ × (1 - r)ᵗ
Where:
S(t) = Supply at time t
S₀ = Initial supply
r = Burn rate per period
t = Time periods
```

### Reward Distribution Model
```
R(h) = (B × P(h)) / S
Where:
R(h) = Reward for holder h
B = Total ETH available
P(h) = Holder h's token balance
S = Total supply
```

### Liquidity Impact Model
```
L(t) = L₀ + ∑(F × 0.012)
Where:
L(t) = Liquidity at time t
L₀ = Initial liquidity
F = Transaction fees
0.012 = Liquidity allocation rate
```
